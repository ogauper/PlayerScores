# PlayerScores

This is a simple command-line app that allows the user to record the scores of a flexible number of players

## Getting Started

Build the application by compiling:

`g++ main.cpp -o PlayerScores`

And run it:

`./PlayerScores [players]`

Where *[players]* should be replaced by one or more names of the players, each separated by a space. For example:

`./PlayerScores Mario Luigi`
